            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p><strong class="eventdetails">We bake some of the best bread, cakes, pastries and tarts you are ever likely to taste.</strong> We are proud to be winners of the 'Best Cupcake Award' for three years running: 2014, 2015 & 2016. We love to innovate, and are always coming up with great new ideas. Although some of our products may not be traditional, we continue to use good old-fashioned methods in our bakery, ensuring that our delicious products are of the highest quality.</p>

            <p>The Cream Cake Company began in 1997 as a family-run business based in Thornbury. We began baking our favourite bread products, cakes and pastries and selling them on Saturdays at nearby <span class="highlight">Preston Market.</span> We soon found that demand for our delicious home-made products meant that we had to move to new premises, and we now work from a fantastic old bakery on Miller street.</p>

            <h2>Great news!</h2>

            <p class="red">We are delighted to announce that we've opened up a new café in Thornbury, where you can enjoy our bread, cakes and pastries along with a great cup of coffee from the <a href="http://www.beanalliance.com.au/" target="_blank">Bean Alliance</a>.</p>
